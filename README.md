# Solving the travelling salesman problem using a genetic algorithm

My high school project from a few years back. I tried to solve the travelling salesman problem (i.e. find the shortest route between a number of cities where you only visit each city once and return to the city of departure) using a genetic algorithm. Genetic algorithms are a heuristic inspired by evolution that is very useful for this kind of problem with a very large solution space.
